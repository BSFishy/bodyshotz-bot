BodyShotZ Bot [![Build Status][build status]][build status img] [![Discord][discord]][discord shield]
=================
Welcome to the official repository for the BodyShotZ Bot. This is the bot used in the BodyShotZ Clan discord, origianally made by
Fyrlex#2740, though this repository has some vast differences from the original bot. Though it is technically possible,
it is not recommended that you attempt to run this bot for your own server, as it has a lot of channels/roles/etc. hard-coded
in. Rather, this repository should be taken as an example for anyone trying to make a bot similar to the BodyShotZ Bot.

Contribution
------------
Anyone is permitted to contribute to this repository, so long as the pull request/flow follows the GitFlow workflow.

Additionally, you can test the bot out, durring development, by creating your own bot, and setting it's token as an environment
variable, with the name `TOKEN`, and another environment variable called `PORT` with whatever port you want the webserver
to be on.
